first
ros2 launch zed_wrapper zed_camera.launch.py   camera_model:=zed2i   publish_urdf:=false   publish_map_tf:=false publish_tf:=false

then publish the transforms information

ros2 launch point_cloud_processor robot_integration_test.launch.py use_zed_localization:=false

and thats all!!

important notes:

there is no map topic, to be done afterwards.
ekf odom fusion is only working with 1 odometry (camera), missing the other one.
should experiment with if better with or without imu (prefusion).
